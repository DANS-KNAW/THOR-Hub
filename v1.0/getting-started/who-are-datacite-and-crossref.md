## DataCite

[DataCite](http://datacite.org) is a non-profit organisation founded in 2009. DataCite wants to help make data more accessible and more useful; its purpose is to develop and support methods to locate, identify and cite data and other research objects. Specifically, the organisation develops and supports the standards behind persistent identifiers for data, and its members assign them.

We bring together actors from the research community to address the challenges of making research objects visible and accessible. Together we constitute a global network of dataset researchers. 

Through collaboration, DataCite:

- supports researchers by helping them to find, identify, and cite research data and other research objects with confidence;

- supports data centres by providing persistent identifiers for datasets, workflows and standards for data publication;

- supports journal publishers by enabling research articles to be linked to the underlying data/objects.
Currently we are working primarily with organisations that host data, such as data centres and libraries.

## Crossref

"Crossref's goal is to be a trusted collaborative organization with broad community connections; authoritative and innovative in support of a persistent, sustainable infrastructure for scholarly communication."

Crossref's general purpose is to promote the development and cooperative use of new and innovative technologies to speed and facilitate scholarly research. Crossref's specific mandate is to be the citation linking backbone for all scholarly information in electronic form. Crossref is a collaborative reference linking service that functions as a sort of digital switchboard. It holds no full text content, but rather effects linkages through Crossref Digital Object Identifiers (Crossref DOI), which are tagged to article metadata supplied by the participating publishers. The end result is an efficient, scalable linking system through which a researcher can click on a reference citation in a journal and access the cited article. 

Any publisher of primary research material in digital form -whether large or small, commercial or non-profit, traditional or non-traditional- can register their content with CrossRef.

A variety of other organisations also participate:

- Libraries use the CrossRef system as part of their localised linking solutions, enriching online catalogues and databases with links to their own full-text holdings where appropriate.
- Intermediaries, including secondary publishers and journal hosting services, use CrossRef as Basic Affiliates and Enhanced Affiliates, enhancing their own products and content offerings with DOI-based citation links.
- Technology companies are creating software tools that interface with CrossRef.
