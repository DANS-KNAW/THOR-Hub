title: "What are persistent identifiers? Selection"

There are multiple PID systems, but which system is most suited to your situation? Archival Resource Keys (ARKs), Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), Handle, OpenURL, Persistent Uniform Resource Locators (PURLs) or Uniform Resource Names (URNs)? Each system has its own particular properties, strengths and weaknesses. The [PID Guide](http://www.ncdd.nl/en/pid-wijzer/) from the Digital Heritage Networkâ€™s Persistent Identifier project helps you learn and think about important PID subjects, and guides your first steps towards selecting a PID system.

Take a look at the [Webinar: Persistent Identifier (S)election Guide by Marcel Ras and Remco van Veenendaal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-HQqpWCcqY) for more information.
