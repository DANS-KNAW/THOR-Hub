More benefits of having an ORCiD:

* The number of publishers requiring an ORCiD upon manuscript submission is growing.
* Less hassle because metadata can be re-used for different e-infrastructures (no need to re-type everything!), so more time to do research.
* More and more funding institutions are supporting the use of ORCiDs. Researchers receiving H2020 funding are encouraged to use their ORCiDs for all communication outputs.
* With an ORCiD it is very easy to get an online overview of all research results.
* Having an ORCiD increases the author’s visibility and it is easier to find the author’s publications.
