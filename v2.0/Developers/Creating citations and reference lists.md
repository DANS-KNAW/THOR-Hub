### Use a reference manager

Handling citations and reference lists is much easier using a reference manager such as [Endnote](https://www.endnote.com), [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com), [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) or [Papers](http://www.papersapp.com/).

[The Orcid-JS library](https://github.com/ORCID/orcid-js) can be used to create citations within webpages.  It leverages citeproc to make over 5000 citation styles available direct from ORCID records.
