title: "How can I use ORCID iDs for peer review recognition services?"
excerpt: ""
---
For researchers, using their ORCID iD to enable connections with the organisations for which they perform reviews raises the visibility of their efforts and contributions. For publishers, funders, associations, research institutions, peer review recognition services, and other organisations involved in review, asking reviewers for their ORCID iD and embedding it in workflows helps streamline processes, improve the management of reviewer databases, and provide reviewers with public and discoverable acknowledgement of their service.
