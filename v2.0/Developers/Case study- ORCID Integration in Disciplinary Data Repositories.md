title: "Case study: ORCID Integration in Disciplinary Data Repositories"
excerpt: ""
---
Researchers need to be linked to their data. Within project THOR, approaches to support the inclusion of ORCID iDs in disciplinary data repositories and data publication workflows have been developed.

The results are published in: [Demonstration of Services to Integrate ORCIDs into Data Records and Database Systems](10.5281/zenodo.58971), where you can read about the successful integration of ORCID in the databases and services of three THOR partners, each serving a distinct discipline: PANGAEA for Earth and Environmental Sciences, EMBL-EBI for Life Sciences, and CERN for High-Energy Physics.

These integrations were applied to live and operational production systems. This means that researchers in these disciplines are already benefiting from automated persistent identifier linking and linkage-information sharing within the global network of persistent identifier infrastructures.

The report describes the common experiences and challenges as well as the specific concerns each institution faced. These case studies can therefore serve as models for other institutions looking at integrating ORCID in their own systems and workflows.

You can find descriptions in the following blog posts:

* [ORCID integration in CERN](https://project-thor.eu/2016/08/17/orcid-integration-series-cern/)
