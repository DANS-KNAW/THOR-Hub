The platform is designed to help people understand what persistent identifiers are, why they exist, what they're used for and how to use them.  It's split into several sections, each aimed at different stakeholder groups.  The best place to start is to choose one of the introductions:

* [Introduction for integrators](doc:introduction-for-integrators) 
* [Introduction for policy makers](doc:introduction-for-policy-makers) 
* [Introduction for publishers](doc:introduction-for-publishers) 
* [Introduction for researchers](doc:introduction-for-researchers)
* [Introduction for librarians and repository managers](doc:introduction-for-librarians-and-repository-managers)
