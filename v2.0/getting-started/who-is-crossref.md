title: "Who is Crossref?"
excerpt: ""
---
[Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/) is a not-for-profit membership organization for scholarly publishing working to make content easy to find, cite, link, and assess.

Ask us about Content Registration with persistent identifiers for linking, Similarity Check for editorial originality, Crossmark for updates and retractions, integrating 90 million metadata records through APIs and Search, and about Event Data for what’s happening outside of the formal literature. We work by rallying the community; tagging metadata; running a shared infrastructure; playing with new technology; and making tools and services to improve research communications. It’s as simple—and as complicated—as that.
