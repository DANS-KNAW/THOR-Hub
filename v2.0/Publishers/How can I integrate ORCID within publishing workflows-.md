title: "How can I integrate ORCID within publishing workflows?"
excerpt: ""
---
How can you reliably connect individuals with their contributions across multiple systems and platforms? How can you make the publishing process easier for your authors, editors, and reviewers? ORCID can help you address these and other challenges. Embedding ORCID iDs in your workflows can help publishers and associations streamline your processes, improve the management of CRM and other people databases, and improve discoverability.

Check out the webinar: [ORCID iDs in academic publishing workflows](https://vimeo.com/album/2536663/video/75349208).

Major publishers have committed to requiring ORCID iDs in the publishing process for their journals and invite other publishers to do the same. Click [here](https://orcid.org/content/requiring-orcid-publication-workflows-open-letter) for more information.
