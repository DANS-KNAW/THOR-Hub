A Persistent IDentifier (PID) is a long-lasting reference to a resource. Often, a PID is associated to a set of metadata describing the object.

In the current scholarly communication environment, two types of PIDs are particularly extended, PIDs for objects (publications, data, software... ) and people (researchers, authors, contributors... ).

You can find a quick description of different identifiers here:
