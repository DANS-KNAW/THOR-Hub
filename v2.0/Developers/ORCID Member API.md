The ORCID Member API enables you to do everything the [Public API](doc:orcid-public-api-tutorial) can do and in addition:

- Add information to an ORCID record, including:
  - works, 
  - employments
  - education
  - peer reviews
  - bio information, such as alternate names and keywords
- Update information that you previously added
- Delete information that you previously added
- Receive notifications when member records change
- Read information marked as 'limited access' (with the users authorisation)

All requests to the Member API require OAuth authentication.  You can obtain client credentials and [prototype against the sandbox](https://orcid.org/content/register-client-application-2) without joining ORCID as a member.
