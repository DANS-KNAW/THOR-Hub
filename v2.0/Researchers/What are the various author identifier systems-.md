title: "What are the various author identifier systems?"
excerpt: ""
---
The following Author identifier and/or profile systems were identified and described by the ODIN project. They are derived from a commonly seen list of tools that researcher are using to manage their scholarly record. See https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1373669.v1 for more information.

**Scopus ID**
* Algorithm based author identifiers and profiles 
* Based on affiliation, subject area and other author characteristics
* Author search is inaccessible to non-subscribers 
* There is an extensive API 
* Some authors have multiple Scopus profiles, especially if the author works in multiple disciplines or institutions 
* No direct editing or claiming but author feedback allows for amendments to profiles 
* A tool is provided to pull the publications from a Scopus author profile into an ORCID profile
* Service provided by Elsevier and integrated with their other products such as Mendeley
* Notably used by the UK research excellence framework (REF)

**ResearcherID**
* User or institution created author identifiers and profiles 
* User populated
* Can create bi-directional links with ORCID profiles 
* Has a process in place to settle inaccurate claim disputes 
* An API is provided, but documentation currently unavailable for assessment
* Service provided by Thompson Reuters and heavily integrated in their other products 
* Around 270k identifiers.

**ORCID ID**
* User driven identifier service
* Users can create, manage and edit their publishing history and import from various other systems 
* Institutions can create blocks of identifiers and ask authors to ‘claim’ them
* Extensive search and authentication API with various open source client implementations 
* Update rights via the API require membership
* More than 4 million identifiers
* Open, sustainable and community governed

**arXiv Author ID**
* Discipline specific (High Energy Physics) author identifier and profile
* Author identifiers are intended to disambiguate papers within the arXiv repository
* User created and maintained, semi-automatically populated
* API unknown

**RePec Author Service**
* Discipline specific (Economics) identifier and profiles
* Users claim from a list of research outputs provided by academic publishers such as Elsevier, Wiley Blackwell, CEPR and institutional archives 
* There is no API 
* Used by RePEc services

**PubMed Author ID**
* Development announced in 2010 and abandoned in 2014 in favour of external identifiers provided by publishers 
* Update specifically mentions ORCID iDs

**Google Scholar Profiles**
* User driven, semi-automated author profiles 
* Initial import is algorithm based with the ability for users to add and remove works
* Continuous algorithmic profile updates possible
* Requires a verified institutional email to make public
* There is no API, and rate limitations and T&C prevent scraping, no interoperability features 
* Manual user driven export possible
* Not intended as an author identifier 
* Provided by Google and integrated with Google Scholar

**Microsoft academic research ID**
* Provides human editable automatically generated author profiles with attached unique identifiers 
* Provides other tools such as co-author visualization, profile merging and citation counts 
* In contrast with Google Scholar, Microsoft do offer an API 
* It is limited by terms and conditions to non-commercial, academic-only use.

**AuthorClaim**
* Non-discipline specific author disambiguation and profiles 
* Generates author output profiles 
* Based on RePEc Author service
* Users claim from a list of research outputs provided by publishers and repositories including Crossref, ArXiv and PubMed
* There is no API, but data is available as bulk download in CC0
* Venerable, in operation since 1992
* Funded by the Open Society Institute

**JISC Names**
* Automatic author disambiguation system with manual intervention and quality assurance
* Generating identifiers and associated research outputs 
* Ran from 2007 until 2013
* Collected data now submitted to ISNI 
* Codebase now open source

**ISNI **
* Semi-automatically derived from library catalogues and other trusted sources using human intervention for quality control 
* Institutions that are members can submit data for matching and ISNI creation. Provides searchable interface and extensive query API 
* Not user editable, although users can suggest changes to existing profiles 
* Intended to be an authoritative source of authorship identifiers

**Linkedin**
* Used to maintain professional resume and publication lists, and network with co-authors and funders 
* Frequently mentioned when discussing author identifiers with researchers 
* Positioning itself as an identity authority as well as profile management tool 
* Mature API for identity and profile.

**Mendeley Profiles**
* User driven and populated author profiles with social networking/collaboration features Manual creation and import 
* Both desktop and mobile software and a service
* Public API 
* Not intended as an author identifier 
* Provided by Mendeley/Elsevier 
* Around 3 million profiles

**ResearchGate**
* Academic social network and collaboration platform for researchers, institutions and publications 
* Users can manage their publishing and work profiles and create connections 
* Provides sharing and citation metrics 
* Open Query API, no update API
