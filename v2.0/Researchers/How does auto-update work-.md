title: "How does auto-update work?"
excerpt: ""
---
In collaboration with CrossRef and DataCite, ORCID has developed the auto-update functionality. If you include your ORCID iD when you submit a manuscript or dataset, your ORCID record is automatically updated when the work is published. This makes managing your scholarly record much simpler and less-time consuming. You need to: (1) use your ORCID iD when submitting a paper or dataset, and (2) authorise Crossref and DataCite to update your ORCID record. If you choose to authorise the auto-update functionality, you can revoke this permission at any time.

See this [ORCID blog post](https://orcid.org/blog/2016/06/24/auto-update-has-arrived-orcid-records-move-next-level) and [Knowledge base article](https://support.orcid.org/knowledgebase/articles/793980-auto-updates-time-saving-and-trust-building) for more information.
