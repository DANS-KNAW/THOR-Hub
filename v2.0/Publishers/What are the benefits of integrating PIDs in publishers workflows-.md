There are many benefits of integrating PIDs into publisher workflows. These include: 

* Creating persistent links to content so that researchers reading a work can always find it and link to related works, even if the content moves.
* Capacity to participate in shared services such as [Event Data].(https://www.datacite.org/eventdata.html) and [Cited-by linking](https://www.crossref.org/services/cited-by/).
* Ability to streamline researcher workflows eg. via [ORCID Auto-update](https://orcid.org/blog/2016/06/24/auto-update-has-arrived-orcid-records-move-next-level).
* Adding funding information to help organisations identify the outputs of the research they funded.
